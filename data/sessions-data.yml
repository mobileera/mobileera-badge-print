  description: "Location-Based Services (LBS) is one of the cornerstones of a successful mobile application. In recent years, developers have been placing their energies on getting their LBS apps to work indoor. One of the innovative solutions is to use beacons as a way to inform the app whenever it is near to a particular location. In this talk, Wei-Meng will discuss the various beacon technologies available today - Apple‚Äôs iBeacon and Google‚Äôs Eddystone, and how you can use it in your own applications."

  title: "Monocultural, Redux"
  description: "Within five years many of us will be changing decade age. Some starting their twenties, others, their thirties and forties, some, their fifties. So, as each year passes, the chance that we will be working with someone who is significantly younger than us, increases. And, of course, it must also be true therefore, that as each year passes the chances of working with someone significantly older, increases. Or does it? If we look around at our community, if we look at the latest reports from Apple, Google, Facebook and others, what we actually see is an enormous skewed demographic."
  # Why is that? Nature has always been strongest when it is at it‚Äôs most diverse‚Ä¶monocultures are a weakness that is destroyed through evolution. Yet our community still often favours a specific monoculture; young, white, males.
  # We work in a time when the brogrammer moniker has given validity to a monoculture, where we have to have movements like #ILookLikeAnEngineer to remind us that we are not all the same, and when, despite a slew of films and TV shows about our community, it‚Äôs still rare to see any one who is of female or of colour.
  # All this during an age when Brexit in the UK, Trumpism in the US and the rise of right wing parties across the world have normalised previously unthinkable levels of prejudice to those not like ourselves.
  # This is not about ageism, racism, or sexism, this is about strength. How do we defend, evolve and cherish our community? How can we be open, welcoming, and supportive to everyone who wants to be a part of this amazing tech revolution? How, with small steps, can we be the change we want to be."

  description: "The Kotlin programming language is gaining popularity amongst the Android developer community. It‚Äôs a modern language that gives more power in everyday routines. Kotlin code generally looks cleaner and nicer, and it‚Äôs much easier to work with when you have less verbosity or code duplication. But what‚Äôs even more important, is that Kotlin is 100% compatible with all existing Java frameworks, and has good tooling in Android Studio and IntelliJ IDEA.
  In this talk we‚Äôll discuss the concepts of the language that provide the desired expressiveness, as well as additional goodies designed specifically for Android."

  description: "Fran√ßois & Syrine will take a glance at the Awareness API and apply it to music recommendations. We are all carrying tiny computers with lots of sensors. With them, we can do more than display content, we can also make these devices aware of the world around us, making them smarter. One way to do this is to leverage the Google Awareness API in order to have rich features with minimal input from the user. It can trigger events when some conditions are put together: when you are close to a certain area, when you plug in headphones, when it is cold or sunny, etc. It can also be used to directly poll the sensors and get some information about the world around you. Using all these capacities to facilitate your life, your device will know what to do and when to do it, with or without your input (as configured by the user).
  In this talk Fran√ßois & Syrine will show you how to improve your music experience and take it to the next stage."

Combining an Xamarin app with Azure App Service is a powerful combination and may save a lot of development time and complexity.<br>
Azure App Service provides all backend functionality such as storage, push notifications, offline synchronization, authentication/authorization management, automatic scaling.<br>
The first half of the talk will be an explanation of Xamarin concepts and architecture, together with an overview of Azure App Service and the benefits and functionality this particular platform-as-a-service provides.<br>
The second half of the talk, I will show by live-coding how easy it is to build a simple app that works across platforms, and furthermore connect the app to an Azure App Service to provide seamless backend communication."

Add to that Angular 2.0 with TypeScript and you will get a truly amazing combination. But I know what you‚Äôre thinking: another way of building apps? What makes NativeScript special? Here are a few cool things:<br>
  - Direct access to native APIs‚Äîno plugins required. Want to create a file on Android? Run new java.io.File()‚Äîin JavaScript!<br>
  - Completely native performance through the use of a JavaScript bridge natively available on all three mobile platforms.<br>
  - Cross-platform libraries for common use cases. Need to call a JSON API? Run http.getJSON()<br>
  - Style native apps using CSS. Yep, that‚Äôs actually a thing.<br>
Curious about how it all works? Come learn! Architectures will be explained; apps will be built; and fun will be had by all."

  description: "At Facebook, new code is being produced and shipped fast in a big code base shared by hundreds of engineers. Thus, we use a number of techniques to ensure good quality of code in this environment, such as unit and end-to-end tests and static analysis. Static analysis is a technique able to detect software errors statically, before a product is actually shipped, and without running the code. In this talk we describe the Infer Static Analyzer, an open source tool developed at Facebook that can find complex bugs such as Null Dereferences and Memory Leaks. It can also run fast in the CI, so that we can catch and fix bugs before code gets committed."
